CLI-AIGENT: AI Agent in Python
This project is a toy agentic code editor built in Python, inspired by advanced tools like Claude Code and Cursorâ€™s agent mode. It leverages the free Google Gemini API to create a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered code agent that can find and 
fix bugs in a real code project.
